# HackReality

Project Submission for Hack Reality 2021

This is a small project whose purpose is to open up a "loading" screen that could be used in any game. 
This loading screen itself is a 3D blender model that has been rendered into an Image.

Here's a little backstory to "The Phoenix Sword"

This sword was forged by a warrior of might: one who only found peace in the chaos of a battle. This brave soul was born a warrior, striving to be the best at everything he did. This tenacity of his earned him the title of "The Pike of Glasgow". Sadly, his days of battle came to an abrupt end when his leg was chopped clean off during "The Great Battle of Aberdene". This had left the man not only physically damaged, but emotionally drained. Never the less, his fierceness remained. He transformed the knowledge of sword fighting into the ability to forge them. With every scar on his body representing his struggle to survive, he fueled his goal of creating a sword that embodied the very definition of Persistence and Pride. He wanted to prove to himself that he is not a just a sorry Walloper, but a soldier capable of fighting to the end. This encouraged him to break the bounds of confidence and determination, allowing him to forge days and nights on end with a halt. Finally, when he, nor his sword could take any more of the heat, he quenched his blade and his soul. The sword itself was not much to speak of. It was bland, with features that are indistinguishable. But to the Pike Glasglow it was as if his very own soul was personified in this blade. And so, he dubbed it "The Phoenix Sword" named after his reborn sense of duty and his undying will to break through the barriers that stand in his path to victory.
